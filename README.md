Here are the readiness levels in use. Later in the alphabet means more ready.

    IMPROVING    -- has a champion and early results
    MATURING     -- definite results, problems are rare
    READY        -- no significant gaps, used in production

Some levels are intermediate and marked with a minus sign `(-)`, when we can resolve progress down to more levels than these three.

## General features

    READY

## Grammars and parsing

    READY

## Object orientation

    READY

## Performance

    MATURING (with spesh, JIT, a profiler, and serious optimization effort)
    will be READY(-) when we have no terrible benchmarks left in perl6-bench
    will be READY when Perl 6 has comparable performance with other P-languages

## Parallelism

    MATURING
    will be READY(-) when SEGV/failure reports are very rarely heard, and we've got implementations with users of the spec'd API
    will be READY when one or more production usages of parallel Perl 6 are reported

## A Perl 6 book

A book, in dead-tree form. (Though kindloid formats are OK too, of course.)
Up-to-date and well-written.

    IMPROVING
    will be MATURING when some up-to-date book (Ã  la "Using Perl 6") is available, online or in print
    will be READY when the "Programming Perl 6" book is available in print

## Ways to get started

Materials that can be found online, such as `doc.perl6.org`, tutorials, blog posts.
