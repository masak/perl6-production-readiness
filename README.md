Here are the readiness levels in use. Later in the alphabet means more ready.

    IMPROVING    -- has a champion and early results
    MATURING     -- definite results, problems are rare
    READY        -- no significant gaps, used in production

Some levels are intermediate and marked with a minus sign `(-)`, when we can resolve progress down to more levels than these three.

## General features

## Performance

    MATURING (with spesh, JIT, a profiler, and serious optimization effort)
    will be READY(-) when we have no terrible benchmarks left in perl6-bench
    will be READY when Perl 6 has comparable performance with other P-languages

## Parallelism

    MATURING
    will be READY(-) when SEGV/failure reports are very rarely heard, and we've got implementations with users of the spec'd API
    will be READY when one or more production usages of parallel Perl 6 are reported
